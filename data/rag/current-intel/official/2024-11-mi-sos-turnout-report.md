# Michigan 2024 Election Turnout Report

- **Turnout rate**: 74.6% of eligible voters (ranked #3 nationally)
- **Active voter turnout**: 79% of registered active voters participated

### Voting Methods Breakdown
- **Absentee/Mail**: 39.2% of votes (over 2.2 million ballots)
- **Early In-Person**: 21% of votes (over 1.2 million ballots)
- **Election Day In-Person**: Remained most popular in 66 of 83 counties

### County Turnout Leaders

3. St. Joseph County: 72.3%
4. Branch County: 72.4%
5. Clare County: 73.1%

## Ingham County Specifics

Ingham County presented a nuanced picture:
- **Result**: Harris won with 64% of the vote
- **Absentee voting**: Nearly 48% of ballots cast absentee
- **Turnout note**: Higher raw voter numbers but lower percentage of registered voters compared to 2020

According to County Clerk Barb Byrum: "In Ingham County, we saw a higher number of voters turn out to vote, but a lower percentage of registered voters who showed up."

## Impact of Proposal 2022-2

The 2024 election was the first presidential election since Michigan voters approved Proposal 2 in 2022, which:
- Established 9 days of early in-person voting
- Expanded absentee voting access
- Made voter registration easier

The data shows strong adoption of these new voting options, with 60%+ of voters using early or absentee methods statewide.

## Relevance to Platform Data

This official turnout data validates the platform's turnout calculations for Ingham County precincts. The county's lower-than-expected turnout percentage despite high raw numbers suggests:
- Population growth outpacing voter registration
- Potential for GOTV efforts in future cycles
- Importance of tracking both absolute and percentage turnout metrics
