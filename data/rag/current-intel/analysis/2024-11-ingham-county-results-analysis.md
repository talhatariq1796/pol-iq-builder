# Ingham County 2024 Election Results Analysis

## Presidential Results

### County-Wide
- **Harris**: 64% (consistent with historical Democratic performance)
- **Trump**: ~35%
- **Margin**: D+29 points

### Comparison to Statewide
- Michigan overall: Trump won (narrow margin)
- Ingham County: Strong Democratic hold
- Gap demonstrates county's significant leftward lean vs. state

## Turnout Analysis

### Raw Numbers vs. Percentage Paradox
County Clerk Barb Byrum highlighted an important nuance:
- **Absolute voters**: Increased from 2020
- **Turnout percentage**: Decreased from 2020
- **Explanation**: Voter registration growth outpaced actual turnout

### Voting Method Preferences
- **Absentee voting**: Nearly 48% of ballots
- Reflects state trend toward mail/early voting post-Proposal 2

## Jurisdiction-Level Patterns

### Urban Core (Lansing)
- Maintained strong Democratic margins
- Higher population density = higher vote concentration
- GOTV efforts show strong return in urban precincts

### Suburban Ring (Meridian, Delhi)
- More competitive than urban core
- Key battleground for marginal gains
- Mix of persuasion and mobilization opportunities

### University Area (East Lansing)
- Strong Democratic performance
- Student turnout key variable
- High volatility between cycles

### Rural/Exurban Areas
- Closer margins than urban areas
- Lower raw vote totals
- Different strategic calculus (efficiency vs. margin)

## Implications for Targeting

### High-Priority Precincts
Based on 2024 results, campaigns should prioritize:
1. **High Swing Potential**: Suburban precincts with margin movement
2. **High GOTV Value**: Urban precincts with turnout gaps
3. **Student Areas**: Volatile but potentially high-yield

### Strategic Takeaways
1. Ingham County remains a Democratic stronghold at the presidential level
2. Down-ballot races show more variation
3. Turnout optimization > persuasion in core Democratic areas
4. Suburban precincts offer best persuasion opportunities

## Data Quality Notes

- Precinct-level results available from Ingham County Clerk
- Some precincts consolidated for reporting purposes
- Student precinct data may show different patterns in midterm vs. presidential years

## Relevance to Platform Scores

The 2024 results validate several platform calculations:
- **Partisan Lean**: D+11.3 county average aligns with strong Harris performance
- **Swing Potential**: Suburban variation confirms elevated scores in those areas
- **Turnout Patterns**: Urban vs. suburban differential matches platform stratification
