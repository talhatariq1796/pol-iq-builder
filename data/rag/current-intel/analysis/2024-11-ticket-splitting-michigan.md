# Ticket-Splitting in Michigan 2024: Trump Voters Who Backed Slotkin

## Key Finding

Democrat Elissa Slotkin won Michigan's U.S. Senate race by 0.33% despite Donald Trump winning the state's presidential race. This narrow victory was partly attributed to Trump voters who either:
- Voted for Slotkin (true ticket-splitters)
- Skipped the Senate race entirely (selective down-ballot voters)

## The Numbers

### Presidential Race (Michigan)
- Trump: Won (narrow margin)
- Harris: Lost

### Senate Race (Michigan)
- Slotkin (D): Won by 0.33%
- Rogers (R): Lost narrowly

### Implied Split
The gap between Trump's performance and Rogers' underperformance indicates meaningful ticket-splitting or down-ballot drop-off among Republican voters.

## Why This Matters

### For Swing Potential Calculations
Ticket-splitting data validates the concept of "persuadable" voters who don't vote straight-ticket. Precincts with:
- High Trump vote + moderate Slotkin vote = persuadable Republicans
- High Harris vote + moderate Slotkin vote = less split (straight-ticket Democrats)

### For Targeting Strategies
1. **Persuasion Targets**: Precincts showing significant Trump-Slotkin split
2. **Mobilization Targets**: Precincts with straight-ticket voting patterns
3. **Efficiency Analysis**: Where do persuasion efforts have highest ROI?

## Historical Context

Michigan has a history of ticket-splitting:
- 2018: Split-ticket voting helped Whitmer win governor while Republicans won other statewide races
- 2020: Biden won while some down-ballot Republicans outperformed
- 2022: Whitmer's strong performance didn't fully translate to legislative races

## Precinct-Level Implications

When analyzing Ingham County precincts:
- **Urban Lansing**: Likely straight-ticket Democratic, lower persuasion opportunity
- **Suburban areas**: Higher potential for ticket-splitting, better persuasion targets
- **University area**: May show ideological inconsistency (socially liberal, economically variable)

## Platform Relevance

The platform's **Persuasion Opportunity** score attempts to identify precincts where:
1. Voters have demonstrated willingness to split tickets
2. Margins are close enough that persuasion matters
3. Demographic indicators suggest persuadable population

The 2024 Slotkin-Trump split provides real-world validation that significant persuadable voter populations exist in Michigan, even in a highly polarized environment.

## Caution Notes

- Individual precinct data on ticket-splitting requires detailed analysis
- Some "split" is actually differential turnout (not same voters choosing differently)
- Candidate quality matters (Slotkin was well-funded, experienced candidate)
