- **Population**: Adults 18+ residing in Michigan

## Actual Results Context

The final election results showed:

## Relevance to Platform Data

This poll, conducted just before the election, showed a very tight generic ballot race. The platform's calculated partisan lean for Ingham County (D+11.3) correctly reflected the county's more Democratic composition compared to the statewide margin.

The poll's indication of a near-even statewide race aligned with the competitive results seen across Michigan, though Democrats performed better in urban areas like Lansing and underperformed in outstate regions.
