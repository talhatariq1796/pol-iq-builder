# Michigan 2026 U.S. Senate Race Overview

## Key Dates

- **Primary Election**: August 4, 2026
- **General Election**: November 3, 2026
- **Filing Deadline**: TBD

## The Open Seat

Incumbent Democratic Senator **Gary Peters** has declined to seek re-election to a third term, creating an open seat race. This is significant because:
- Open seat races are typically more competitive than incumbent races
- Michigan's recent Senate races have been extremely close (Slotkin won by 0.33% in 2024)
- Both parties see this as a potential pickup opportunity

## Current Race Rating

| Analyst | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| Cook Political Report | Toss-up |
| Sabato's Crystal Ball | Toss-up |

## Democratic Candidates

   - Known for manufacturing and economic policy focus

2. **State Sen. Mallory McMorrow**
   - Rose to national prominence with viral floor speech
   - Represents Oakland County in State Senate
   - Strong grassroots fundraising

3. **Dr. Abdul El-Sayed**
   - Wayne County Health Director

   - Announced mid-April 2025

### Declined
- Rep. Bill Huizenga - Announced July 23, 2025 he would not run

## Strategic Implications for Ingham County

### Why This Race Matters Locally

1. **Competitive Statewide Race**: Toss-up rating means every vote counts; Ingham County's D+11 lean is a critical Democratic stronghold

2. **Candidate Profiles**:
   - McMorrow's progressive profile may energize East Lansing/MSU voters
   - Stevens' suburban appeal may resonate in Meridian Township
   - Rogers' 2024 near-win shows Republican competitiveness

3. **Turnout Dynamics**:
   - Midterm elections typically see lower turnout than presidential years
   - Student vote at MSU will be crucial for Democrats
   - 2022 showed strong Democratic midterm performance in Michigan

### Targeting Considerations

- **GOTV Priority**: High in Democratic base precincts (Lansing, East Lansing)
- **Persuasion Targets**: Suburban precincts that may have ticket-split in 2024
- **Swing Potential**: Watch for primary dynamics affecting general election positioning

## Timeline to Watch

- **2025 Q4**: Candidate announcements and early fundraising
- **2026 Q1-Q2**: Primary campaign intensifies
- **August 2026**: Primary election - critical for both parties
- **Fall 2026**: General election campaign

## Data Notes

This race will be incorporated into platform targeting scores as candidate-specific data becomes available. Current partisan lean and turnout projections remain relevant baseline metrics.
